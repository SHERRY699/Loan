<p>RE: Request for Investigation of Unauthorized Inquiry</p>

<p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>

<p>I checked my personal credit report, which I acquired from your organization on (INSERT DATE OF REPORT), and I noticed that this unauthorized inquiry had been made:</p>

<p>{dispute_item_and_explanation}</p>

<p>I contacted {CREDITOR/FURNISHERS NAME}, who placed the inquiry, and asked them to remove their credit inquiry from my credit profile. I also asked them to cease their illegal activities immediately, but to date, there have been no responses from their office. Since sending the letter more than 30 business days ago, they have failed to respond and honor my request.</p>

<p>Therefore, I must request your help in resolving this matter. In accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I request you immediately initiate an investigation into this inquiry on my credit report to determine who authorized the inquiry. If, once your investigation is complete, you find my allegation to be true, please remove the unauthorized inquiry from my credit report and send me an updated copy of my credit report at my address listed above. If you do find the inquiry referenced above to be valid, I request that you please send me a full description of the procedures used in your investigation within 15 business days of the completion of the investigation.</p>

<p>Thank you for your help and assistance.</p>

<p>Please see my reasons for dispute below:</p>

<p>It is not my intention to threaten frivolously, but rather to emphasize the seriousness of the matter at hand. I have sent {NUMBER OF LETTERS} previous letters to your organization, all by certified mail (receipts enclosed), requesting the removal of inaccurate information from my credit file. Regrettably, these requests have been ignored.</p>

<p>I assert that these accounts contain inaccurate information, and I believe your company has violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act by failing to conduct a proper investigation as requested in my previous communications. Each of my previous letters outlined valid reasons for dispute, supported by evidence.</p>

<p>If this final request does not prompt a proper investigation of the disputed accounts and the provision of proof of their correction, I will have no choice but to file a lawsuit in my county seeking damages. I take my credit integrity seriously, and your lack of professionalism and assistance in this matter is deeply disappointing.</p>

<p>I am well aware of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and I am prepared to pursue them to the fullest extent if necessary. I await your prompt response.</p>

I have sent {NUMBER OF LETTERS} previous letters to your organization, all by certified mail (receipts enclosed), requesting the removal of inaccurate information from my file. Regrettably, these requests have been ignored.</p>

<p>I assert that these accounts contain inaccurate information, and I believe your company has violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act by failing to conduct a proper investigation as requested in my previous communications. Each of my previous letters outlined valid reasons for dispute, supported by evidence.</p>

<p>If this final request does not prompt a proper investigation of the disputed accounts and the provision of proof of their correction, I will have no choice but to file a lawsuit in my county seeking damages. I take my credit integrity seriously, and your lack of professionalism and assistance in this matter is deeply disappointing.</p>

<p>I am well aware of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and I am prepared to pursue them to the fullest extent if necessary. I await your prompt response.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
